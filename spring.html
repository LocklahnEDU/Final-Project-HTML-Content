            <h2>Spring in Utah</h2>
            <p>
                March begins with cold weather at the start of the spring season in Utah. Early spring is prone to cold fronts,
                 and the arid land has sizable daily temperature differences. A moderate amount of rain falls in March, 
                 and the rest takes the form of snow. In April, temperatures rise with the advance of the spring season in Utah.
                  Measurable snowfall recedes and most ski resorts end operations mid-April. Spring blooms, rain showers and increasing
                   sunshine dominate the last two weeks of April. Typically, May is a very pleasant month across the state. Temperatures are moderate,
                the length of the days and sunshine are longer and there are enough rainstorms to keep it cool.

            <h2>Three interesting flowers in spring</h2>
            
            <p>The Desert Trumpet: The Desert trumpet plant possesses very small yellow or pink flowers and an inflated stem just below branching segments.
                The swelling of the stems was assumed to have been influenced by the presence of certain insects yet recent studies seem to believe it
                is due to high concentrations of carbon dioxide in the solid stem and seems to be related to gas regulation.
            </p>
           

            <p>The Lupine Flower: The lupine flower, also known as lupin or bluebonnet, looks like a wildflower, 
                but it is a fast-growing legume in the pea family that just happens to have a tall, showy spire 
                of colorful blooms that are typically purple. Lupins also have soft green to grey-green leaves which
                 may be densely coated in silvery hairs</p>

            <p>The Desert Marigold: In springtime, these wildflowers start producing a cycle of blooms that can 
                continue all the way through to autumn, depending on water availability. Desert marigold occur in a basal cluster. 
                From this arises several flower stems, usually carrying a single yellow radiate 
                flower each, although they may have 2 to 3 flowers on a stem
