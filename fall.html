            <h2>Fall in Utah</h2>
            <p>
                The beginning of September can still bring hot days, but this is generally when temperatures start to cool. There are approximately 
                six days of rainfall and daylight hours dwindle. Leafs start to change color in September and really hit their stride by October.
                 In October, temperatures continue to cool, leaves continue to change color and snow begins to fall, though it usually doesn’t accumulate.
                  By November, temperatures have gone from warm to cold and rain falls for nine days on average during the month. Snow begins to accumulate
                   in the mountains and ski resorts tend to open toward the end of the month.

            <h2>Three interesting flowers in fall</h2>
            
            <p>The Rocky Mountain Aster: The rocky mountain aster grow to heights between 20 and 60 centimeters (8 and 24 inches). Leaves are widely lance-shaped
                 to oblong and pointed The plant usually produces only one flower head, each with 7-21 blue or lavender ray flowers surrounding yellow disc
                  flowers.</p>

            <p>The Blanket Flower: The Blanket flower is native to North and South America. It was named after Maître Gaillard de Charentonneau,
                 an 18th-century French magistrate who was an enthusiastic botanist. They can be almost any shade of yellow, orange, red, purplish,
                  brown, white, or bicolored. They are sometimes rolledinto a funnel shape. There are many tubular disc florets at the center of the head 
                  in a similar range of colors, and usually tipped with hairs.</p>

            <p>The Dahlia Flower: There are 49 species of dahlia, with flowers in almost every hue (except blue), with hybrids commonly grown as garden plants.
                Like most plants that do not attract pollinating insects through scent, they are brightly colored, displaying most hues, with the exception of blue.
