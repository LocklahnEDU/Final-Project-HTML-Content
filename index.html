                seasons and serves to highlight a few different species that stand out amongst the rest. Feel free to click on the images of flowers

            <h2>The Nature of Utah</h2>
            
            <p>Utah is home to many different climates and enviroments from the green forests, clear creeks and dry deserts as well as freezing cold winters
                and sweltering summers. Because of this it is no suprise that Utah is home to such a large variety of flora throughout the year.

            <h2>Creator Info</h2>
            <p>Hello! I am Locklahn Francis a student at weber state university and I have created this website about the flowers of utah throughout
                 the seasons for my final project of CS 2350. Using what I have learned througout the semester this website is using CSS styles, html elements,
                 and Javascript to make a interactive and interesting website.
