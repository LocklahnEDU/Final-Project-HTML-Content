            <h2>Winter in Utah</h2>
            <p>
                Winter lasts from December through February with long periods of snowfall, freezing temperatures and short daylight hours. December and 
                January are the coldest months of the year. The shortest day is December 21, (winter solstice) with just nine hours of daylight. February
                 brings a mix of winter and spring weather with sneak peeks of warmer temperatures and more sunshine.

            <h2>Three interesting flowers in winter</h2>
            
            <p>The Western Blue Violet: Native to eastern and western North America, Viola adunca (Western Blue Violet) is a low-growing, spreading perennial
                 forming a neat clump of heart-shaped, dark green leaves. Blooming in mid-spring and sometimes intermittently into late summer, attractive,
                  small, lavender-blue flowers</p>

            <p>The Dianthus Flower: Native to most of Europe and western Asia. It can also be found in many parts of North America,
                 where it is an introduced species. Dianthus are characterized by grassy, often blue-green leaves. The flowers are usually 
                 pink or purple flowers, and almost always with five petals. The petals are frequently jagged or crimped, looking as though
                  they had been clipped</p>

            <p>The Pale Alyssum: It is native to Eurasia, but it can be found throughout much of the temperate world as an introduced species
                 and sometimes a common weed. This is a hairy annual or biennial herb producing stems which grow upright or lie along the ground
                  to a maximum length of 30 to 40 centimeters. It produces yellow flowers Mayâ€“July that fade to white with four small petals</p>
