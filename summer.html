            <h2>Summer in Utah</h2>
            <p> 
                In June, summer kicks off with enjoyable temperatures, abundant sunshine, and occasional rainfall. 
                June has the longest days of the year, peaking at 15 hours of daylight on the summer solstice. July
                 and August are the warmest months of the year with the same range of average high temperatures. These 
                 are the driest (least humid) months with the least amount of rainfall.

            <h2>Three interesting flowers in summer</h2>
            
            <p>The Sego Lily: The plant is native to a number of western states and have 1 to 4 flowers, each with 3 white petals which are tinged with lilac
                (occasionally magenta) and have a purplish band radiating from the yellow base. A yellow petaled form with deep purple bands is known from Petrified
                Forest National Park. The common name of sego comes from a similar Shoshone word. It is the state flower of Utah.</p>

            <p>The Columbine Flower: Columbine (Aquilegia), aka grannyâ€™s bonnet, is a perennial flower that blooms in the spring. There are more than
                 70 species of columbines, including native columbines that grow wild in mountain areas, along stream beds, and in temperate woodlands.
                  The deep-blue columbines that grow as wildflowers in the Colorado mountains are direct descendants of the earliest columbines.</p>

            <p>The Mountain Bluebell: The mountain bluebell is native to the western United States, in California, Nevada, Utah, and Oregon. It often grows in a moist habitat,
                 such as subalpine meadows and creeksides. It often carpets large areas of meadow and hillside with blue-green foliage and sweet-scented
                  bluebell blooms</p>
